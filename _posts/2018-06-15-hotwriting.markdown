Hotwriting is a cross-platform (PC/MAC/Linux) book of poems you can play and perform. You can do things like take a poetry solo in a James Brown Song, make Steve Ballmer yell developers, and try to write an email from a detention facility. Some of the poems are funny, some are sad, they're all different. I can confidently say you've never tried anything like this before.

Hotwriting is available from my publisher, **[Instar Books](http://instarbooks.com/books/hotwriting.html)**, and on **[itch.io](https://toddwords.itch.io/hotwriting)**.

**FROM THE PUBLISHER:**

Todd Anderson, impresario of Manhattan's digital art performance WordHack, creates poetic experiences using Javascript, sound design, and a wireless USB keyboard that he wears around his neck. He calls this "hotwriting." And here in this collection that erases the line between book, instrument, and game (as well as between author and audience), Anderson presents the first collection of hotwriting pieces, curated experiments in language, form, interactivity, and multimedia synaesthesia.

Earworm loops of popular music combine with Steve Ballmer screams, with VCR apotheosis, with investigations into the interplay between alchemy and Dungeons and Dragons mechanics. This is human connection in a repressive regime, this is Lyndon Johnson's 1948 Senate race, this is the struggle to remain vulnerable to beauty in an increasingly cluttered media world. The reader is invited to rewind, erase, distort, and to dismantle each of these sentiments and narratives, or simply to experience them as they proceed.

The reader is invited to make a bear explode.

This collection is an executable file that plays the digital code poems, in addition to mundane texts, now to be forever known as "coldwriting."

Also included in this collection is a set of full instructions for remixing the included text, as well as instructions for the reader to create and disseminate her own Hotwritten experiments.
