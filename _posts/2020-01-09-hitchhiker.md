HitchHiker is a chrome extension for doing live performances inside other people’s web browsers. A performer creates a room and any number of audience members can join through the extension interface. Whenever the performer goes to a new website on their computer, all of the audience members are taken to that website. The performer can then modify the content of the website, speak through text-to-speech voice, play sounds or layer images on top of the screen, all of which is conveyed onto every audience members’ browser. This tool can be used for remote performances, or for hybrid live performances with many computers in the same space as well as some remote participants. The pictures below were taken from an evening of live performances at CultureHub on November 1st 2019 by Lívia Sá. The project can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/toddwords/HitchHiker).
